## Data Normalization | Data Engineer Virtual Internship | Kalbe Nutritionals

The company, Kalbe Nutritionals, requires the formation of a new Data Warehouse due to the growing volume of data. The team aims to follow the rules of normalization for the new Data Warehouse. As a new Data Engineer, focus on creating the queries for the tables to achieve 2nd Normal Form (2NF) first. Afterward, verify if the tables meet the criteria for 3rd Normal Form (3NF). If they don't comply, continue making adjustments until they satisfy the 3NF rules. Additionally, design Stored Procedures to facilitate the insertion of new items into the tables based on the 3NF structure and the corresponding columns for the new items.
